      </h1>
      <p>
        I am a highly skilled software engineer with about 20 years of extensive
        experience in web, full-stack, frontend, and mobile development. Most

        I am passionate about building clean, maintainable code and fostering a
        positive development environment. I am also a strong advocate for clear
        communication and collaboration, ensuring all stakeholders are aligned.
